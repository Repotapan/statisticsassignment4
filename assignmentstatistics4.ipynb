    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating population parameters, such as the population mean or population proportion, from sample data. It involves making inferences about population characteristics based on sample data, using either point estimates or interval estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimate refers to a single value that is used to estimate a population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, while the sample proportion is a point estimate of the population proportion. Point estimates are often calculated as the sample statistic that best represents the population parameter. However, they do not provide any information about the uncertainty or variability associated with the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimate, on the other hand, provides a range of plausible values for a population parameter. It is also called a confidence interval. A confidence interval is constructed based on the sample statistic and its associated standard error. The interval estimate consists of two values, an upper bound and a lower bound, which define the range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean would provide a range of values within which the population mean is estimated to lie with a 95% level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimates are more informative than point estimates because they provide a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate. They allow us to quantify the level of confidence we have in our estimate and determine the precision of our estimate. However, interval estimates are wider than point estimates, which means that they are less precise."

    "The significance of the p-value lies in its ability to help researchers and decision-makers determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Typically, a predetermined significance level (alpha) is chosen, such as 0.05 or 0.01, which represents the maximum probability of a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true). If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, then the null hypothesis is rejected, and it is concluded that there is evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, then the null hypothesis is not rejected, and it is concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",

A small p-value does not necessarily indicate a large or important effect, and a large p-value does not necessarily indicate a small or unimportant effect. It is also not a measure of the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true. Therefore, the p-value should be considered in conjunction with other factors, such as effect size, study design, and practical significance, when making decisions based on the results of hypothesis tests."
